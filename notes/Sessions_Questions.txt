*   Why accessing HttpSession object can only be possible through HttpServletRequest and not normal ServletRequest ?

>>  Session management is an HTTP-specific feature, and HttpSession is an abstraction for managing user sessions in an 
    HTTP context. 

    On the other hand, ServletResponse is a generic interface designed for all types of servlets, including HTTP, FTP, 
    or other protocols.

*   When asking for HttpSession object, how does servlet container identifies which HttpSession object to return since 
    there could be multiple user's session in sytem memory ?

>>  The servlet container uses a session identifier (session ID) to associate a specific session object with the user's 
    request. 
    
    This session ID is unique for each session and works as follows:

    How it works:

        (1) Session ID Generation:

            - When a new session is created (request.getSession()), the server generates a unique session ID.
            
            - The session ID is stored on the server side along with the session object in memory or persistent storage.
        
        (2) Session ID Storage on Client-Side:

            - The session ID is sent to the client in one of the following ways:
                
                (a) Cookies:
                 
                    - The most common method. The servlet container sets a cookie named JSESSIONID with the session ID.
        
                (b) URL Rewriting: 
                
                    - If cookies are disabled in the client browser, the session ID is appended to the URL as a query 
                      parameter (e.g., http://example.com/home;jsessionid=123456789).
        
        (3) Session ID Retrieval:

            - For subsequent requests, the client includes the session ID With cookies (browser automatically sends 
              JSESSIONID to the server) or With URL rewriting (client passes the session ID in the query parameter).
        
        (4) Session Lookup:

            - The servlet container retrieves the session ID from the incoming request (either from the cookie or URL).
        
            - Using the session ID, the container looks up the corresponding HttpSession object stored in memory or a 
              session store.
